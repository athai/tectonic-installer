# Scaling an application on Tectonic

Kubernetes can scale applications either statically, based on an explicit count of replicas, or dynamically, adding and removing replicas based on application load.

This tutorial outlines static application scaling in Tectonic.

* Scaling an application from 3 replicas up to 5 using `kubectl` and Tectonic Console.
* Monitoring this change in the Tectonic Console.

This guide continues the previous tutorial, in which an [app was installed][first-app] on a Tectonic cluster.

## Scaling a deployment with Tectonic Console

To control application scale in Tectonic Console, first create a new `cookies` deployment that defines a number of `replicas`for the deployment.

1. Click *Workloads > Deployments*.
2. Click *Create Deployment* to open the YAML manifest editor, with a skeletal manifest file. Delete the example YAML, and paste the `cookies` Deployment's manifest described below into the editor.
3. Click *Create* to save and instantiate the `cookies` deployment manifest.

`cookies` deployment manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cookies
  namespace: default
  labels:
    k8s-app: simple
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: cookies
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: cookies-container
          image: quay.io/coreos/example-app:v1.0
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
          readinessProbe:
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 80
             scheme: HTTP
          livenessProbe:
           initialDelaySeconds: 30
           timeoutSeconds: 1
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 80
             scheme: HTTP
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
```

Then, use the Console to scale the deployment.

1. Click *Workloads > Deployments*.
2. Click the *cookies* deployment to open its *Overview* page.
3. Under *Desired Count*, click the current number of pods to open the *Modify Desired Count* dialog.
4. Enter a new number, and click *Save Desired Count* to change the number of healthy pods the deployment will maintain.

Use Tectonic Console to edit the manifest and scale the deployment.

1. Click *Workloads > Deployments*.
2. Click the *cookies* deployment to open its *Overview* page.
3. Click the *YAML* tab to open an editable deployment manifest.

Change the `replicas` count to the desired number of pods in the deployment. In this example, the `cookies` deployment is scaled from 3 pods to 5.

```sh
spec:
  replicas: 5   # bump from 3 to 5
```

Click *Save Changes* to scale the deployment to the new number of pods.

## Monitoring deployment scale in Tectonic Console

Use the *Pods* tab of a given deployment to track the number of replicas, and their health.

## Scaling a deployment with kubectl

First, copy the `cookies` deployment manifest described above into a file named `cookies.yaml`.

If you compare this deployment with the `simple-deployment` in the [previous tutorial][first-app], you'll notice a few additions. These additional lines set up health checks and rolling update features.

Next, use `kubectl create` to deploy `cookies.yaml`:

```sh
$ kubectl create -f cookies.yaml
deployment "cookies" created
$ kubectl get deployments/cookies
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cookies   3         3         3            3           18s
```

Then, open `cookies.yaml` in a text editor, and change the `replicas` value to 5:

```sh
spec:
  replicas: 5   # bump from 3 to 5
```

Use `kubectl apply` to apply the changes:

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f cookies.yaml
deployment "cookies" configured
$ kubectl get deploy/cookies
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cookies   5         5         5            5           1m
```

Notice the pod count increases from 3 to 5.

### Scaling a deployment with the kubectl scale subcommand

Deployments can be also be scaled directly on the `kubectl` command line with the `scale` subcommand. The following command scales the `cookies` deployment back down to three replicas.

```sh
$ kubectl scale deployments/cookies --replicas=3
deployment "cookies" scaled
$ kubectl get deployments/cookies
NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cookies              3         3         3            3           6m
```
